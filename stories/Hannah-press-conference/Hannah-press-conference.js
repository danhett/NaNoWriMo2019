She's waiting in the press pool with a cameraman and dozens of other reporters. Some of them she recognises from the local beat, but most she doesn't - people have travelled for this, and with good reason. The city is still on relative lockdown after the attack a few hours ago, and aside from a mass of social media speculation from the public there's been no official statement or anything concrete confirmed.","\n","^The press pool is a roped-off area full of other reporters and camera operators, in front of a wide stage big enough for three people, empty microphones and chairs sit waiting in front of a police-branded backdrop, lit by harsh and unflinching spotlighting. She's stood in front of this stage countless times, as distraught mothers appeal for missing teenagers to come home, or high-ranking policemen deliver statements about unfolding events. That's what this is, but she's never seen one this big.","\n","^She glances around and spots an old colleague from her early days the paper, Johnny, now working for the regional TV channel in the city, not that it's helping much presumably, everyone's in the dark. He catches her eye, and shuffles through the bodies and equipment. Like her, he has a notebook in his hand and an audio recorder primed. Like her, he looks tired.","\n","^\"Nice night for it, christ.

What's it really like down there?\"","\n","^John raises an eyebrow ever so slightly, as if to say 'I know what this is, but I'll play along'. He theatrically looks over his shoulder, checking for pretend listeners-in.","\n","^\"Between you and I, and this isn't for print, I've got a contact in the police who's quietly uh, confirmed, a few bits. Nothing we can use officially, but he's said the attacker was a pretty young lad, local too. And get this - there was another guy with another device. They found the device and carried out a controlled detonation on it, got him on CCTV but he's nowhere to be found. Bottled it, clean exit, god knows how.\"","\n","^Hannah's eyes widened.

Hannah doesn't recognise two of them, but the man in the middle is someone that needs no introduction to anyone watching - Mark Anderson, the Chief Constable in the city, an experienced and often imposing figure in policing in the city, and someone well versed in delivering the most difficult updates to both the public, and the media.","\n","^He sits patiently under the harsh bright lighting, seemingly unfazed by the cameras or microphones directed him. He's placed a single page of notes on the table in front of him.","\n","^Towards the side of the stage, a uniformed officer closes the door to the room. Anderson picks up the notes, and there's another swell of clicking cameras and lights as he begins to speak.","\n","^\"Good evening, thankyou for attending this press update at short notice. My name is Chief Constable Mark Anderson, I'm joined here by colleagues from the British Intelligence Services and the Police Counter-Terrorism Operations team, who will introduce themselves shortly.\"","\n","^The cameras have stopped clicking now. The press pool is quiet.","\n","^\"The facts so far are these: at approximately 16:20 this afternoon, a large detonation occured in the vicinity of the Upper High Street shopping district, caused by what we believe to be a lone suicide attacker. So far, seven fatalities have been confirmed, and the emergency services are dealing with a high number of injured members of the public, some with life-threatening injuries.\"","\n","^He pauses briefly. Cameras click again, and a flash illuminates the wall for a moment. He continues.","\n","^\"Due to the nature and scale of this incident, it is possible the death toll could rise. There are a significant number of members of the public currently unaccounted for, and the emergency services are working closely with hospitals and families to piece together the status of everyone involved in the incident. We have set up an emergency contact line for anyone currently seeking to locate individuals, which has already been distributed to the media and should be visible on the screens behind me.\"","\n","^Murmurs and looks are already being exchanged in the audience. Anderson waits for this to die back down, and speaks again.","\n","^\"For obvious reasons, a perimeter has been established around the area, meaning the centre of the city will be closed for the forseeable future. This is critical, allowing the emergency services to do their work, and the investigation teams to do theirs. We ask that both press and members of the public avoid the city centre unless absolutely neccessary, this includes use of the hospitals unless critical.\"","\n","^He glances briefly to the younger man sat on the left of the stage, then does the same to the young woman sat on his right.","\n","^\"We'll now be able to answer questions pertaining to the incident, please keep these brief and constructive.\"","\n","^There's a surge in chatter among the press pool, microphones extend a little further and lights are focused.
