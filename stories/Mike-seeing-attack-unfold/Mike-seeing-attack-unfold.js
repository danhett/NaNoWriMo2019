Long day. It's evening, kids are in bed, and he's settling into the routine now, monitoring a list of feeds and accounts, conversation notifications flashing gently at the bottom of the screen.","\n","^The picture on the profile is definitely him, but his face is obscured by a coat pulled up over his face, and the name sitting next to it on the screen is definitely not the one on his driving license. Keep the distance, be smart about it. He has a few lives, does Mike: home life, work life, online life. Movement life. Like so many, he draws the boundaries and keep them clear, too many lads in too many groups have ended up in hot water. Not that they've done anything wrong in his book, but that's how the world is at the moment. He's one node in a big network, linked by the same sites, driven by the same objectives. It's a movement, and growing, but you have to use a little common sense while you go about it.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"story_start.0.4.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":18},{"s":["^Look at the conversations ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"story_start.0.5.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":18},{"s":["^Keep scrolling through social media.

He never turns it off, preferring to pick up the threads all in one go once he's settled in.","\n","^There's a couple of pals in a group chat pinging memes and Fantasy Football trades around, his brother hassling him about Christmas plans, and a few notifications from people he doesn't know. Not in real life anyway. These are the people from his groups and feeds that he's gotten closer to, digitally. These are the people without real names, like him. Their avatars are flags, lions, and a lot of footy stuff - he's not so into the football but it's part and parcel of a lot of the lads and he knows enough to get by in the pub at least. He checks a few of the threads, mostly re-posts of an immigration story that did the rounds, and a lot of chatter about the upcoming local elections. Outrage all over, it never ends.","\n",{"->":"brew_choice"},{"#f":1}],"check_social_media":["^Mike tabs through a few social media channels. Twitter is quiet at this time of night, and he tends to not use it unless there's something going on. Handy at protests and when stories are hot, but for general updates he prefers Facebook. Like his other channels, he uses a different name here, eyes everywhere and all that. He runs a few big groups here, couple of local ones are noisy at the moment talking about the local elections - there's a Muslim candidate standing in the next town over, young guy, new to the area. /Of course he is/, Mike thinks to himself wryly. There's some football match on the go at the moment too, judging by the memes and banter clouding a lot of the groups. There's always a bit of overlap between this stuff and the football lads, he doesn't follow the game much but knows enough to get by in the pub.","\n",{"->":"brew_choice"},{"#f":1}],"brew_choice":[["^He stretches, stands up, and wanders into the kitchen - like always, he's in search of biscuits and a fresh brew.

With the other hand he fishes his phone out of his pocket and glances at the notification on the front screen.","\n","^There's one message unread, from Darren, a mate he knows from protests and a few local groups. They don't speak much unless they're organising actions, so seeing his flag avatar pop up is a surprise. The notification only has one sentence on it:","\n","^\"are u watching the TV mate\"","\n","^Mike frowns at the message. Something gone on at the football maybe?","\n","^He starts composing a reply with one thumb, and the hot water spills over the edge of the mug while he wasn't watching.

Mike's confused about the messages, wondering what's gone on that's so interesting. There's a sports newscaster on the screen, sat behind a brightly-lit desk, surrounded by scrolling football scores and news tickers describing the weekend's transfer news. Occasionally the feed switches to a roving match reporter, usually stood in a big pair of headphones holding a microphone at some miserable dive of a stadium, trying to sound enthusiastic about a dull 0-0 draw between two towns even the locals barely give a toss about.","\n","^He watches for a few minutes. Ordinary weekend stuff, nothing's going on.
