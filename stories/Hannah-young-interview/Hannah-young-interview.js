Hannah curses at the brick of a phone she's been issued by the paper, and shoves it into her coat pocket where she can feel the heavy thing weighing her down.","\n","^As the newest - and youngest - reporter on a small local paper's team, she's getting used to being given these shit assignments already.

Not the /big/ stuff, oh no, far too junior for the really meaty stories. No. Hannah gets the Tough Stuff - the ambulance-chasing, the sad photos, the invasive questions outside the courthouse. This is the side of the job she hates, and of course also the part of the job that she gets the most flack for. Like she wants to be here.","\n","^This one's a doozy. She's here to cold-call a local woman, apparently her husband... is that \"husband\"? Hannah can't read her own scrawl... yeah, her husband, is in intensive care following a hit and run. No suspects, police calling out for witnesses, and he's in a proper state by the sounds of things. Circling the drain they think. And of course, she's been sent here to get the quote off this poor fucking woman, under the pretence of helping catch the driver.","\n","^Hannah knows how this works by now.

Her hands are in her pockets, pulling her coat in against the wind. In her left pocket is her spiral-bound notebook and a chewed biro, in her right is that stupid phone. She knows why she's here, and it sure as fuck isn't to help find witnesses, or whatever she's going to tell this poor woman anyway. She knows deep down that she's here to get to the sad part, the horrible story, the isn't-it-awful for the paper's healthy population of local rubberneckers.","\n","^She thinks about this a lot. This is the job. She knew what she was getting into, but wow only up to a point. This is the worst one she's been sent on, and she's in two minds about even pressing the doorbell. Is it worth further ruining this poor person's already horrific day, just to grab some more details and invade her space? Or, looking at it the other way, /is/ it possible that there's a glimmer or truth in the claim that the story might convince witnesses to come forward?","\n","^The wind is still blowing.

Then, over the noise of the wind and rain, Hannah hears a couple of mechanical clicks and bumps as locks are opened on the other side of the door. The door swings open.
