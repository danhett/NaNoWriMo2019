Ellie is walking through the building holding a laptop a cup of shitty coffee, same as every day. The last few days have been intense, this new focus has energised the team, but it's been a wide net to cast and already the scale of the job is starting to weigh on her.","\n","^She enters the main office room, the familiar quiet hum of the lights and machines greets her as she throws her stuff next to the desk and sits down.

The screen winks on, and prompts her for her password. She taps it in with one finger while draining the end of the coffee, throwing the empty cup into the trash with a dozen others.","\n","^She stretches, yawns, and settles in to catch up.","\n",{"->":"use_computer"},{"#f":1}],"use_computer":[["ev","str","^Check emails.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Check news.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},"ev","str","^Check staff messaging.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-2","flg":20},{"*":".^.c-3","flg":24},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"check_emails"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"check_news"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-2":["^ ",{"->":"check_messaging"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-3":[{"->":"see_IM"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"check_emails":["^Ellie opens her email client. As ever when you work in a place like this, they mount up quickly, and are largely unimportant. Today is no different, endless updates on minor projects she's barely involved with, some social stuff, and a lot of technical automated emails from garbage she's subscribed to.","\n","^She's about to select everything and hit 'Mark as read' when she notices one of the automated alert emails contains a search query she was running yesterday.","\n","^Interesting. The returned data suggests that the username pattern she loosely identified might have some weight to it after all, the algorithms have found a number of possible matches that align with her hunch. There's a huge amount of data to sift through, a few day's worth for a small team, and it needs a human eye to really glean the subtle stuff, but it's a start.","\n","^Ellie allows herself the faintest hint of a smile, then continues.","\n",{"->":"use_computer"},{"#f":1}],"check_news":["^She flicks to her news client. Ellie prefers a quick and focused version of the day's news, so she uses a customised interface that scrapes the major sites for points of interest and serves it to her in a succinct list. She's busy and knows her way around this stuff better than the people who host the sites, and this way she gets the guts of the info without having to wade through pages of pointless exposition. Ellie is very matter-of-fact like that.","\n","^Things seem as unpredictible as ever. There's election chaos again, the whole of the UK apparently picking their sides, picking their tribes. Ellie is skeptical about a lot of this, though - what happened to policies of personalities? People are so easily swayed by the media, she wonders if things would be different if everyone got their news the way she tries to: unbiased, from a wide spectrum of sources. Not a chance though, this stuff is big business. Some people are making a lot of money while politics in the UK eats itself...","\n","^There's one other item that draws her eye, relating to another supposed counter-incursion by UK forces in Syria. These are the stories she really worries about, knowing that this kind of action is so often the reason for retaliatory terror strikes against the west. She isn't sure where she stands politically, unsure if there's really a reason for our forces to be out there after all these years, but one thing she does know is that the problem won't go away if these incursions continue. She frowns, reading the rest of the story from a few different sources. The whole story is framed completely differently across different publications - is it justice and help we're bringing to the middle east, or quiet continuation of conflict? It depends on where you get you news from, apparently. No wonder people in this country can't agree on anything, everything is so polarised.","\n","^Ellie makes a mental note to factor this into the next round of threat assessment work, and continues.","\n",{"->":"use_computer"},{"#f":1}],"check_messaging":["^Ellie switches to the internal chat system. Technically it's supposed to be used for official work, internal comms, all that stuff. Of course, half the messages in there are inter-staff waffling, complaints about the mess in the kitchen, and too many emojis.","\n","^There's a security alert notice from an admin pinned to the top, reminding everyone to adhere to the stringent password and crypto policies the service are supposed to use for everything. She does, but many don't. Ellie wonders what triggered this latest round of worrying from the higher-ups, and whether it has any connection to the elevated chatter and digital noise she and her team have been monitoring over the last few days.","\n","^She marks the message as 'read' and continues.","\n",{"->":"use_computer"},{"#f":1}],"see_IM":[["^\"El...
