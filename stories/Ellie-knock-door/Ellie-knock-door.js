There's a quiet but insistent hum of activity around her - hushed chatter, electronic chimes, phones ringing, and the constant and almost imperceptible hum of the harsh strip lighting hanging above her.","\n","^Cutting-edge intelligence technology crammed into a crumbling building, she thought. Never changes.","\n","^She pauses for a moment. There's nobody in the corridor. Just Ellie, the door, and a security camera looking down at her. A red light blinks on the front. Ellie knows that behind the door is Malcolm Thorn, her direct superior at the agency, and the person who will either greenlight her continuing investigation or likely shut her down and send her back to the desk. There's never any middle ground, especially this time: regular operative staff like her are usually summoned to this door, but this time she made the request.","\n","^Perhaps she should wait.
